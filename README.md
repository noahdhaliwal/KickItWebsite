# KickItWebsite

This project is a website designed for a non-profit organization dedicated to raising funds and awareness for suicide prevention and mental health, known as Kick It for a Cause Inc.

Although it is off the beaten path, in terms of course material, it could provide a template or example of a website to be used for other projects/applications looking to house information about their mission and their creators. This website plans to include pages for information about those involved, information about upcoming events and promotions, sign-ups for events, and (time-permitting) fielding  donations and selling organization merchandise.
